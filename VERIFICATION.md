# Verification

Verification will use directed SystemVerilog/cocotb unit tests, independent
Python reference models, differential comparisons, deterministic randomized
tests, subsystem integration tests, and increasingly realistic software
execution. The authoritative pre-commit gate will be exposed as
`make regression`; routine development will use `make test`.

No executable verification infrastructure exists yet. It is introduced in
small Phase 0 milestones.

## Command contract

The top-level `Makefile` owns the developer interface. `make test` is the
routine gate and `make regression` is the authoritative pre-commit gate.
`make lint`, `make unit`, `make differential`, `make randomized`,
`make integration`, `make software`, and `make waves` remain distinct so each
verification layer can run independently. Pending layers fail explicitly until
their implementation milestone completes.
