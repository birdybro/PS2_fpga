# Verification

Verification will use directed SystemVerilog/cocotb unit tests, independent
Python reference models, differential comparisons, deterministic randomized
tests, subsystem integration tests, and increasingly realistic software
execution. The authoritative pre-commit gate will be exposed as
`make regression`; routine development will use `make test`.

No executable verification infrastructure exists yet. It is introduced in
small Phase 0 milestones.
