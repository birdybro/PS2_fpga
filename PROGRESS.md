- External blockers: none
- Most recent pushed commit: M013 milestone commit (current `HEAD`; exact hash in `git log`)

## Resume note

Development is on `main` with remote
`https://github.com/birdybro/PS2_fpga.git`. The pinned local environment uses
Verilator 5.050, Python 3.14, cocotb, and pytest. `make ci` is the complete
local verification gate. Architecture implementation has not started; resume
with the single active milestone in `milestones.yaml`.
