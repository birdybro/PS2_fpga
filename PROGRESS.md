# Progress

- Last completed milestone: M019 — add behavioral byte-addressed system RAM
- Next milestone: M020 — implement aligned 32-bit RAM reads
- Current subsystem: behavioral system memory
- Current regression status: 32 tests pass with no skips; RAM storage targeted test and full regression pass
- Known architectural inaccuracies: all PS2 architecture is unimplemented
- Known timing inaccuracies: no PS2 architectural timing model exists
- External blockers: none
- Most recent pushed commit: M019 milestone commit (current `HEAD`; exact hash in `git log`)

## Resume note

Development is on `main` with remote
`https://github.com/birdybro/PS2_fpga.git`. The pinned local environment uses
Verilator 5.050, Python 3.14, cocotb, and pytest. `make ci` is the complete
local verification gate. Architecture implementation has not started; resume
with the single active milestone in `milestones.yaml`.
